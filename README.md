# Caveats

* Purists will tell you that you're a pussy who can't play the game.  This is normal and expected behavior.
* This is intended for use on Windows.  It's not guaranteed to work on Linux.  In fact, it probably won't.
* Updates that change the structure of Persistent Instance Storage or mission data may cause this to break.  Already-hacked saves should be okay, but are not guaranteed to work.
